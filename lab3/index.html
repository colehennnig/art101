	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The idea for this lab was to create a file structure and learn how to link
	local files to the website.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I had a lot of trouble successfully getting the grid to look the way I
		wanted. It was hard to work with text and images using the grids.<p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here are the images of my file structure and homepage.<p>
	<img src="img/html.png" width="500">
	<p>HTML of my homepage.</p>
	<img src="img/webpagecss1.png" width="500">
	<img src="img/webpagecss2.png" width="500">
	<p>CSS of my homepage.</p>
	<img src="img/webpage.png" width="500">
	<p>My homepage.</p>
